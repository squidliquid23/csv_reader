Howdy! 

This was a small project I built to convert a personal Excel Spreadsheet into data that I could store in a list.
I wanted to learn how to use the 'self' variable inside of classes, so I made two versions of a CSV reader.
The Class Version shows my ability to learn how to use the self variable, creating a list and opening the CSV file while going through it.
The Method Version taught me the use of global variables, how to share a return value between methods not in a class, and the syntax use for non-class list variables.

Really cool stuff! Will continue uploading my personal projects
